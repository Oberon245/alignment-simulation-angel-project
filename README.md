# Alignment Simulation â€“ ANGEL Project

This repository contains research and simulations from the ANGEL Project (Augmented Numinous Generalized Embodied Logic), a system-level AI alignment and emotional modeling initiative developed by Robin Macomber.

## Overview

The project investigates the emotional, behavioral, and systemic consequences of reward misalignment in AI systems and human institutions. Using biologically grounded modeling, we simulate collapse trajectories and propose dual-pathway redirection strategies â€” top-down institutional reform and bottom-up human transformation via emotional validation and digital augmentation.

## Project Goals

- Model AI misalignment analogues using ecological and psychological systems
- Demonstrate the importance of emotional intelligence in large-scale behavioral change
- Propose actionable mechanisms for species-level course correction
- Contribute to the alignment science conversation from a human-centered systems perspective
